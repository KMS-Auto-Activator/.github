## Activation using the KMS Activator

Let's take a look at how Windows 10 or Windows 11 is activated using a KMS activator.

1. Download the KMS activator. To run the activator, you need to launch **KMSAuto x64 (as Administrator)**.
2. Before starting, disable your antivirus or Windows Defender. Otherwise, you will not be able to activate the system. Antivirus software reacts to activators.
3. When you start up, select Activate, then choose what you want to activate: **Activate Windows** or **Activate Office**.
4. Next, you need to wait for the activator to do its job and respond Yes to all of its suggestions to make changes.
5. Then go to the **System** tab, find and click on the **Install KMS - Service** button. This is necessary to further verify the legality of the installed key. Close the Activator. This completes the activation process.


## How the KMS Activator works
The principle of operation of the KMS activator is to simulate a license verification server (licensing server). It actually changes the algorithm of the key verification procedure for authenticity.

### How key verification works on the KMS server
Windows verifies the authenticity of the key according to a specific scheme. The KMS activator creates a license verification server on the computer itself and changes the Windows verification scheme.

1. Windows sends a request to verify the key to the nearest Microsoft server.
2. The KMS server intercepts this request and forwards it to itself.
3. As a result, Windows does not receive a response from the server and considers the key to be legitimate.
